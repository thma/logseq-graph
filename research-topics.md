	- higher order functions and closed cartesian cats
	  @TODO: write an update to the pattern article
	- conduit as an example for the pipeline monad 
	  @TODO: write update to pattern article
	- P-combinator corresponds to IO Monad
- Coding
	- Have a Haskell to Latex generator 
	  Similar to latexify for pathon which allows to translate ordinary python function declaration to latex formulars
	- Finish BigFloating implementation in HasBigDecimals
	- Finish DependencyChecker for layerered an onion architectures (with explicit white- and black-lists)
	- learn NIX
	- check our java-effects
	  => if feasible, rewrite PolysemyCleanArchitecture
	- Have a GHCUP TUI for Windows 
	  => it seems that bricks and vty currently do not support windows
